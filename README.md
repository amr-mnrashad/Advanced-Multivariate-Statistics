# Advanced-Multivariate-Statistics
This project covers:
- Data exploration
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Multivariate hypothesis testing (MANOVA)
- Attribute interrelationships to unveil insights into the complex dynamics of football player statistics in FIFA 22 (CCA).

Through rigorous statistical analyses, I aim to shed light on the factors that define player positions, their statistical distinctions, and how these attributes culminate in a player's overall performance rating.
